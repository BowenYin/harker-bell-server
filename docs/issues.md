# Known Issues

This is a running list of known issues relating to the web app or other services.

- uBlock Origin Ad Blocker: There is currently an issue with the [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) ad blocker where the extension blocks certain scripts from loading, preventing the app from receiving updates. We recommend you whitelist the site or switch to a different ad blocker.
- Internet Explorer 11 Support: IE 11 support is still spotty. We will implement fixes in future updates.

If you encounter any other issues or find a mistake in the bell schedule, let us know by emailing [dev@harker.org](mailto:dev@harker.org).
